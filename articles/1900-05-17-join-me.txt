This project was idealized in partnership with [Carolina Ferraz][01] and we had the chance to expose it at the Semana de Design da PUC-RIO in 2011. "Join Me" is an Iphone app that makes
it easier to find a friend. The application was created for young people wanting to locate friends that are close to them and thus interact with them quickly and simply through
text messages or calls. In addition to the location, JoinMe also allows you to view availability (busy or idle) of the contacts application user, letting you know if you can interact with
your friends at that particular moment. 
With privacy options, availability and new fast ways of viewing friends, Join Me is simple and efficient for those who wish to communicate with friends.
