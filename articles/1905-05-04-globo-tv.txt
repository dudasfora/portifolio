After watching Andrew Price's [tutorial][01] on how to make a realistic earth, I decided to make my own so I could tweak with the materials and see how they work and how far can you take them. In this project the
modeling is a simple sphere where all the focus is on the material
and the transition from day to night, wich I accomplished with the
composition nodes that Blender has.
