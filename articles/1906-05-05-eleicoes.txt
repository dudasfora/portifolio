During my internship at Globo.com I had the chance of being part of the 2012 Brazillian municipal 
election for mayors, deputy mayors and city councillors project. In the project I was tasked to spearhead 
the layout of the page that gave the results of the election, in the 1st and 2nd turn, which happens if there 
is a tie between candidates,  and to finish it. 
This was a challenging project because Globo is the most important media group in Brazil and I was responsible 
for making decisions that ended up with 12,2 million unique pageviews just in the first turn. I was also tasked 
with the creation of a “ticker”/ box, that was at the homepage of the news part of the globo.com, that showed the 
progression of the elections. It was also in my responsability to create a lightbox that showed the user the proposal 
of each mayoral candidate.
