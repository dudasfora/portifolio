On the 18th and 19th,October 2012, was held at globo.com a
FedEx Day, a hackathon that began at 2pm on the 18th and
ended with the presentation of the project at 4pm on the 19th.
During this event I created and thought about the layout the
interactions of an automated tumblr for the developers of
globo.com who wanted to share useful tips with the dev
community. I needed to do it in one
afternoon so it could be developed during the night. Also it needed
to be simple. The main focus is the content, so I had to make
something that wouldn’t stand out to much while still being
recognizable and memorable.
