My first project at globo.com was the Globo.tv. When I got involved with the project it was already in development but it wasn't on production. I took part in its creation and 
later on I helped with the responsible design of it. Here you can see the 2.0 version website on different resolutions, which I was responsible for creating under the supervision of Federico 
Arana, the designer of the project. I was also in charge of creating the error pages, and of couse, its responsible solutions. Besides being part of the creation process, I also was the responsible
for all image treatment seen on the website.
